# To-do-list
A playful and personal profile page built with love and curiosity. This repository serves as the foundation for showcasing my journey as a developer — blending creativity, clean design, and hands-on learning. Whether you're here to explore my work, connect through links, or just say hi, this page reflects who I am and what I’m building.
